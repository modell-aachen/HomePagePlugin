---++ Usage

This plugin makes the Default frontpage configurable - any time a user goes to %SCRIPTURL{view}% they will be shown the topic =configured= 
by the Foswiki administrator in ={HomePagePlugin}{SiteDefaultTopic}= in the Extensions section of =configure=.


---++ TemplateLogin configurable HomePage on login
The Admin can also =configure= ={HomePagePlugin}{GotoHomePageOnLogin}= so Foswiki Always show user's 
HomePage (from the UserForm field in their User topic.) when they log in (makes sense if users have personalised home pages.) 
__Note__ that this means that any URL's emailed to them will only be useful after login.
